To run the program, use
    ./out init_file_name VA_file_name 
OR:
    Place lines for init into   "init.txt"
    Place line for VA into      "va.txt"
    ./out

Result will be in "output.txt"


If ./out does not exist or does not work, 
    do
        g++ main.cpp function.cpp handleFile.cpp -o out 
    OR
        make
then follow above instructions.
